double spherical_distance(p_lat,p_long,q_lat,q_long)
{
    acos(sin(p_lat)*sin(q_lat)+cos(p_lat)*cos(q_lat)*cos(p_long - q_long))*r;
}

since cos(a-b) = cos(a)*cos(b) + sin(a)*sin(b), we can simplify the above method to:

double spherical_distance(p_lat,p_long,q_lat,q_long)
{
    acos(sin(p_lat)*sin(q_lat)+cos(p_lat)*cos(q_lat)*cos(p_long)*cos(q_long)+
                    cos(p_lat)*cos(q_lat)*sin(p_long)*sin(q_long))*r;
}
